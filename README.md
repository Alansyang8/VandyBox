# VandyBox
App for Vandy Film Lovers

Project Introduction: 
The increase in the use of Over-The-Top (OTT) media services have made movie watching more accessible for many movie enthusiasts compared to the time when movies were only available in theaters or by a rental system. Despite its increased accessibility, movie watchers are now overwhelmed by the wide variety of movies that they are able to choose from and therefore have a harder time finding a movie they want to watch. Vandy Box aims to mitigate this issue by creating a movie recommendation platform for the Vanderbilt community to expedite the tedious process of looking for a movie to watch.
Vandy Box is a movie recommendation generator/social media platform for any movie watcher within the Vanderbilt scope. A Vandy Box user can range from a film major student to a CS professor who only watches movies once a year, consulting our movie recommendation algorithm and ratings whenever they are looking for the perfect movie watch over the weekend or with friends.
